# Nando Lang

[![CI](https://github.com/hintron/nando-lang/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hintron/nando-lang/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repo contains a set of beginning exercises and tasks to help you learn the
C programming language and basic CPU architecture.

These tasks are meant for beginners who know very basic programming in a
high-level language. Basic knowledge of functions, variables, strings, loops,
etc. will be assumed by the exercises, though C-specific syntax will not be.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As a prerequisite, please do the "Learn the Basics" portion
> of the [Learn C](https://www.learn-c.org/) exercises (at least complete up to
> the "Functions" lesson).

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid the temptation to look at solutions or to use AI - these exercises
> are designed to help you learn by doing, so try to solve them on your own,
> and type them out manually.


# Quickstart

## Make sure C compilers are installed

We will install different C compilers depending on the operating system (OS) you
use. The main operating systems are macOS (Apple), Windows (Microsoft), and
Linux.

> [!TIP] The most popular C compilers (like MSVC) are really a combined C and
> C++ compiler, since C++ is a superset of C. This means that C programs are
> also valid C++ programs.


### macOS

The `clang` C/C++ compiler should automatically be avaialable to use.


### Linux (or WSL)

The `gcc` C/C++ compiler should automatically be available to use. If it's not,
install the "build-essentials" or "gcc" package for you Linux distro.

E.g., for Ubuntu, do:
```
sudo apt install build-essentials
```

`clang` can also be installed on Linux if you prefer `clang`.


### Windows

For Windows, we will install the native `msvc` C/C++ compiler.

> [!TIP] If you are on Windows, but want to use a Linux environment, consider
> using Window's WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). This gives you a full Linux
> installation on Windows, and you can then follow the Linux instructions.

<details><summary>Windows MSVC installation instructions</summary>
Go to the [Visual Studios downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
and download ["Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022"](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe).
Once downloaded, run that .exe file.

Click the "Individual components" tab, and search for "MSVC latest" and select
the component with "x86/64 build tools (Latest)". Also search for "Windows 11"
and select the Windows 11 SDK version with the highest number.

Alternatively, under the "Workloads" tab, you can just select "Desktop
development with C++".

Click `Install`.

> [!INFO] For official documentation on how to install a C compiler on Windows, see
> [Walkthrough: Compile a C program on the command line](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-compile-a-c-program-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170)

### Download

To download Nando lang, go to https://github.com/hintron/nando-lang/releases and
download the source code. Extract it to a directory

> [!NOTE] Don't use Git to clone the repo. We're keeping it simple.


### Compile the Checker Program

First, determine the terminal program to use.

* macOS: `terminal`
* Linux: `konsole`
  * > [!NOTE]
    > If using WSL, you will already be using a terminal program.
* Windows: Developer PowerShell for VS 2022
  * > [!NOTE]
    > You must use a "Developer" version of PowerShell, or else `msvc` will
    > not be available.


Next, go inside the nando-lang directory you just downloaded:

```
cd <path-to-nando-lang-directory>
```

> [!TIP]
> Use [tab completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion) to
> quickly select file paths in the terminal and as a sanity check that the file
> exists.

Then, build the checker program with the following command, depending on which
OS you are on:

```
# If on Linux:
gcc src/main.c -o checker
# If on macOS
clang src/main.c -o checker
# If on Windows
cl src/main.c
```


Next, run the checker with no arguments:

```
./checker
```

This will display an introductory blurb with your first instructions. These
instructions will tell you what exercise to first start editing.

### Edit, Compile, and Run Exercise Code

Edit your source code files using a coding text editor like
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
[NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

Once you have edited the exercise, compile it in your terminal with this
command:

```
# Linux
gcc exercises/<exercise>.c -Wall
# macOS
clang exercises/<exercise>.c -Wall
```

> [!TIP]
> Replace `<exercise>.c` with the exercise you are working on

> [!TIP]
> The `-Wall` is optional - it will display warnings that could indicate problems
> in your code, but these warnings do not prevent the code from being compiled.

This will compile your code and generate `a.out` if compilation succeeded.
`a.out` is your compiled program. Each time you compile, `a.out` will get
overwritten with the latest compiled changes to your program.

Run `a.out` to make sure your program does what you wanted:

```
./a.out
```

When you are satisfied that it does what you want, give it to the checker to run
and see if you pass the exercise!:

```
./checker a.out
```

If you pass, the checker will tell you the next exercise to work on.
